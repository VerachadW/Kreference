# Kreference [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/VerachadW/Kreference.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/VerachadW/Kreference)
Preference as Properties for Kotlin Android.

## Installation
Add this line to your ```build.gradle```

    compile "com.github.verachadw:kreference:0.7.0"
    
## Features
- One line Preference item declaration
- Null-Safety
- Allow default value for preference item
- Support traditional style to get/set preference item. This is useful when ```Context``` is 
not available at class initialization
- Support Non-Primitive type e.g. ```Date```

## Overview
When you want to get/set a String in SharedPreference in Android. You need this bunch of code
```kotlin
    object PreferenceHelper {
        fun getMyPrefString(context: Context): String? {
            val preference = context.getSharedPreferences("myPref", Context.MODE_PRIVATE)
            return preference.getString("myString")
        }

        fun setMyPrefString(context: Context, newString) {
            val preference = context.getSharedPreferences("myPref", Context.MODE_PRIVATE)
            val editor = preference.edit()
            editor.putString("myString", new String)
            editor.apply()
        }
    }

    // Get value in Activity
    PreferenceHelper.getMyPrefString(this)
    // Set value in Activity
    PreferenceHelper.setMyPrefString(this, "This is not simple :(")
```

A lot of work just to handle 1 item. Is it better if you can write those stuff as one-liner, or even better as a property in class? Kreference make that happen for you. Here is how we declare ```myString``` with Kreference.
```kotlin
    // Declare in Activity. No need for additional class.
    private val myString by Kreference.asString(this)
    ...
    // Use it as same as variable in activity
    textView.setText(myString)
    myString = "This is simple and lovely :)"
```

Since Kreference used the variable's name as a key of preference item, You can easily access preference item in different classes by using the same variable name.
 ```kotlin
     object MyPref1 {
        val myTime by Kreference.asLong(this)
     }

     object MyPref2 {
        val myTime by Kreference.asLong(this)
     }

    // This is true
     MyPref1.myTime == MyPref2.myTime
 ```

From some usecases, we want to use ```Kreference```, but the ```Context``` object cannot be accessible during class initialization( e.g. ```BoardCastReceiver```). Since we cannot decalre properties as local variable, ```Kreference``` provide get/set methods to obtain preference item easily. Here are some example.
```kotlin
    //Getter
    Kreference.get<String>(context, "myString", "default-value")
    
    //Setter
    Kreference.set<String>(context, "myString", "new-value")
    
```
